			<p class="dotting">doting by henry green</p>
			<img src="images/fiction/01.jpg">
			<p class="readmore">Doting, the last of Henry Green’s novels, is, as its title would suggest, a story of yearning and lusting and aging in which a wife and a brash young woman run hilarious circles around a hapless hardworking civil servant suddenly seized by long-dormant urges. Like its immediate predecessor, Nothing, it stands out from the rest of Green’s work in its brilliant, experimental use of dialogue. Green was fascinated with the extravagance, ambiguity, absurdity, and unintentional implications and consequences of everyday human communication.</p>

			<p class="patriots">the patriots by sana krasikov</p>
			<img src="images/fiction/02.jpg">
			<p class="readmore">“A thoroughly researched and deeply felt historical novel . . . Krasikov skillfully moves between voices and decades, never neglecting the moral difficulties of life under a totalitarian regime. There is compassion here, as well as humor, but most of all, a keen awareness of how people strive to be good in dire circumstances. The Patriots is an ambitious, unsentimental and astonishingly masterful first novel with a singular portrayal of living by conviction, no matter the cost.”—BookPage</p>
